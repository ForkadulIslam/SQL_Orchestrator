There might have been some issues with docker as my Windows machine was getting slowed down. That is why I have added my SQL file as well.
My postman collection are given below 
POST : {{local}}/user/addMultiple
[
    [1, "tom", "France", null],
    [2, "sammy", "France", null]
]

Please keep this structure to have an smoth testing . My nodeJs version was 20
